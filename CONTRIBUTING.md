# Contributing to the Universal Acceptance Project in Uganda

Thank you once again for your interest in joining this project! 👏🏾 🎊 🎉

The [UA in Uganda Project](https://github.com/Universal-Acceptance-for-You/universal-acceptance-in-uganda) aims to develop a toolkit that can support these efforts and write a policy brief that will be used as an advocacy tool to inform policy. We hope that this can influence national and industry digital inclusion projects to promote local content and multiple language scripts. 

This document (CONTRIBUTING.md) is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project. These are guidelines, not rules, to make it easy for anyone to get involved.
