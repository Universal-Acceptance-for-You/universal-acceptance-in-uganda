## Aims and Objectives
Our project would like to contribute to Universal Acceptance (UA) efforts, from a Ugandan and East African perspective by creating awareness and sharing technical training content with policy/decision makers, software developers, website owners, researchers, technology enthusiasts, Internet end users, open source communities, among others, to understand UA and why it matters. At the intersection of UA and data science, we hope to work with the open data community to build a repository of resources to promote the adoption of new Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and updating existing ones to allow more language scripts.  

Our aim is to develop a toolkit that can support these efforts and write a policy brief that will be used as an advocacy tool to inform policy. We hope that this can influence national and industry digital inclusion projects to promote local content and multiple language scripts. 

This README explains the Universal Acceptance Project in Uganda, what inspired us to start and how you can get involved.

## Background
For any device to communicate with another on the Internet, it needs a unique identifier - a name or an Internet Protocol (IP) address. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) community develops policies that allow these identifiers to work well. Until 2010, the global Domain Name System (DNS) only allowed Top Level Domains (TLDs) which are in the Latin script. The DNS then expanded to include Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) for country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs) and domain names for other TLDs. However, many language scripts and writing styles are used around the world, many of which are currently not supported by web browsers, email clients and software applications. This is where Universal Acceptance (UA) comes in.

## Why Universal Acceptance?
UA helps to remove technical barriers for users, meaning that all TLDs should be able to work within all software and email applications regardless of the language script or number of characters.  It is a foundational requirement for a truly multilingual Internet to remove  linguistic barriers for accessing the Internet by allowing people to use native/indegenous languages and in turn bringing more people online. 

According to the Universal Acceptance Steering Group (UASG) country readiness report (2020), the goal of UA is for these email addresses ÊµãËØï1@server.technology and ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØŸäÿ©.ÿ±ÿ≥ŸäŸÑ@ÿØŸàŸÜ to have the same rate of acceptance as user@test.org. However, many organisations and businesses have not yet updated their systems to make this possible. In 2020, 9.7% of email servers were potentially configured to support email addresses in local languages and scripts. Chinese and Arabic are among the top spoken languages globally, yet only 11% of the top 1,000 websites globally support email addresses in these languages. 

There are over 40 languages spoken in Uganda and over 140 spoken in East and Central Africa. Language has been named as one of the barriers of connecting the unconnected yet it would give the world‚Äôs population an opportunity to access the Internet. Local language domain names can help to support the creation and access to local language content and email addresses. 

## Resources and how you can contribute
Please take a look our [Open Canvas](https://github.com/Universal-Acceptance-for-You/universal-acceptance-in-uganda/blob/main/Open%20Canvas%20-%20UA4You(Feb%202021).pdf) to give you an overview of the project.
